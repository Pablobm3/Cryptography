(a) To calculate the number of possible keys starting with the given sequence of bytes, we must take into account that each byte has 256 possible values (0 to 255). Since the given sequence is 24 bytes, the total number of possible keys starting with this sequence is:

256^104 = 2^832

That is, there are 2 to the 832 possible keys.

To estimate the time it would take for a brute-force attack to recover the password, we need to know the processing speed of our computer and the efficiency of our brute-force attack algorithm. Assuming we use an average computer with a processing speed of 1 GHz, and assuming we can try 1 million keys per second, we would need:

2^832 / (10^6 * 10^9) seconds

which is equivalent to:

2^832 / 10^15 seconds

which is an extremely large number and practically impossible to achieve. Even if we use an extremely fast and efficient computer, such as a supercomputer, it would probably take years or even decades to recover the key.
