(a) To calculate the number of possible keys starting with the given sequence of bytes, we must take into account that each byte has 256 possible values (0 to 255). Since the given sequence is 24 bytes, the total number of possible keys starting with this sequence is:

256^104 = 2^832

That is, there are 2 to the 832 possible keys.

To estimate the time it would take for a brute-force attack to recover the password, we need to know the processing speed of our computer and the efficiency of our brute-force attack algorithm. Assuming we use an average computer with a processing speed of 1 GHz, and assuming we can try 1 million keys per second, we would need:

2^832 / (10^6 * 10^9) seconds

which is equivalent to:

2^832 / 10^15 seconds

which is an extremely large number and practically impossible to achieve. Even if we use an extremely fast and efficient computer, such as a supercomputer, it would probably take years or even decades to recover the key.

Corentin:

Due to some weird software fault a part of C. Johnson’s 128-bit AES key, which was used to
encrypt text notes of great scientific value, got overwritten with zeros. The only information left
is a sequence of the first few bytes of the key that is 81596bfb39c62b716e52db9181.

(a) Your task now is to compute the number of possible keys that start with the byte sequence
from above on a theoretical basis and to estimate the expected amount of time to retrieve
the password using a brute-force attack based on your computer’s speed.

	Answer:
	
	There are only 128 bits in the key and we know the first bytes of the key: 81596bfb39c62b716e52db9181, that is the first 26 hexadecimal characters of the key.
	Knowing that a hexadecimal character corresponds to 16 possibilities, that is to say 2⁴ (0 to 15) so also 4 bits. So we have 128-(26*4)=24 bits left to find on the original 128.
	These 24 bits represent 2²⁴ = 16777216 possibilities.

	To estimate the time it would take for a brute-force attack to recover the password, we need to know the processing speed of our computer and the efficiency of our brute-force attack algorithm.
